# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project analyzes COVID-19 data to uncover trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations. Using Python for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization, the project highlights critical insights that support data-driven decision-making.

## 📅 Timeline
**June 2023 – July 2023**

## 📌 Objective
To analyze and visualize COVID-19 trends across regions, identify patterns in vaccination impact, and support public health insights through interactive dashboards.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Rows:** 18,000+  
- **Source:** Publicly available COVID-19 dataset (e.g., [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus))  
- **Contents:**  
  - Date  
  - Country/Region  
  - Confirmed cases  
  - Deaths  
  - Vaccination data  
  - Population  

> Note: The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using Python before loading into Power BI.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` (for data wrangling and exploration)
- **Power BI**: For interactive dashboards and visual storytelling

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- **Line Charts**: Trend of daily confirmed cases and deaths over time
- **Tree Maps**: Country-wise share of total cases and vaccinations
- **Bar Charts**: Top 10 countries by vaccination rate
- **Filters/Slicers**: For regional and temporal comparisons

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Countries with high vaccination rates showed a significant drop in new cases.
- Regional disparities in vaccination drives were strongly linked to case resurgence.
- Certain months showed spikes aligned with policy changes or new variants.

## 💡 Impact
- Helped highlight the effectiveness of vaccines in reducing case numbers.
- Identified regions needing better resource allocation.
- Demonstrated how data visualization can aid public health strategy.
